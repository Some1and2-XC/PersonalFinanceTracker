# PersonalFinanceTracker
My very own personal finance tracker app

Organise your money-spending habits by recording your receipts into the app

After that, this app will show you statistics about your payment habits and give
you insights that you never had before.

The creator of this app believes in complete privacy in the storage of data,
so all receipts are stored in your device only; This application has no connection
to the internet.
