## About

**[?]** Tracks personal finances of the user. Lets people store their data locally
without giving anyone access to their expenditure. 

> **Purpose**: I wanted people to have complete privacy and control over their
> spending habits through this app.

> However, looking at the market, most apps
> seem to be connected to an online database, meaning their data gets stored in
> someone else's server. This app tries to solve that privacy concern by storing
> data within the device and attempting to provide the same set of features.
